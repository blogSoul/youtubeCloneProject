## 퀴즈 확인하기! 😑

MongoDB is a SQL Database : False  
Mongo is the same as Mongoose : False  
What is the difference between Mongo and Mongoose : Mongo is a database, Mongoose is how we talk to the database using JS  
What is the point of using dotenv : To be able to hide strings from the version control systems  
What is a Schema : Is an object that tells Mongoose the shape of the data that we will save  
It's a good practice so save files on a database : False  
If I want to save a file what should I do : Save a link to the location of the file on the database  
What does Mongo store? : JSON Documents  
What is the "ObjectId" type for? : To tell Mongoose that here we are gonna save an ID of a different Model  
What is the difference between Date.now and Date.now() when adding a "createdAt" to a model : Date.now() executes the function immediately, Date.now waits for the function to be called.  
What does "mongoose.model("Movie", MovieSchema)" do : It tells Mongoose that the "Movie" model will have the shape of the MovieSchema  
On the video #3 .4 why did we import the models in the init.js file : Because we need to make the mongoose connection 'aware' of the Models that we will save in the future.
